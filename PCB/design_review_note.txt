//1. Change backup labels to corresponding SWD signal names
2.
//3. Use PA9, 10(UART1) for boot loader/programming. Don't use UART3 because it may be muxed to other funtions.
//4. Don't use 3mil ground plane, minimum 6mil ground
5. Add ground to signal pins.
//6. Use consistent header types.
7. Vias under voltage regulator need to have solder mask
//8. reset labels are different, change to the same label and connect them.
//9. Mux is too close to the FTDI chip
10. Add decoupling capacitors for the mux
//11. Don't switch layer for the oscillator circuit and USB datalines
//12. Add zener diode between VREF+ and GND.
//13. Put Oscillator capacitors to top layer.
//14. The resistors for the oscillator circuit are probably not needed.
//15. Add decoupling capacitors between all power supplies and GND.
//16. Reroute decoupling capacitors for the microcontroller. The electrical path is too far.
